<i>"Saving trees for greener future"</i>

A Flutter based project that tracks the trees in your locality and tell us about the needs of sapling.

## Theme

Ecology, Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Management.

## Problem

Every year saplings are planted across Odish during different events with a lot of enthusiasm However, most of them die untimely death due to lack of care and maintenance.

## About

In our day-to-day life, we're facing too many problems related to our environment. And one of that problems is the dying of plants and improper care of pre-existing saplings. So, we've come up with the idea of creating a flutter-based app with ML which tells us about the health of saplings in a particular area. It also tells us the requirement for saplings due to climate change, like- water, fertilizer, etc. It can have a feature that will notify the nearby people that these plants require care.

## Objectives

- Locate planted saplings on Google Maps and track their status (whether they have grown, need watering, manure, etc.)
- Create a database of such saplings/trees with geo-spatial references.
- To ensure healthy growth of trees and proper management.
- To spread awareness about tree plantation to the local citizens.
- Provide a mechanism to get real-time alerts (e.g. via email/SMS) to the concerned people for required actions.

## Proposed Solution

- Use Google Maps API and track tree status (whether they have grown, need watering, manure, etc.)
- Database of such saplings/trees with geo-spatial references.
- Use machine learning to predict the survival of a sapling and take preventive measures
- Use predictive analysis to come up with a growth forecast of such saplings/trees
- Provide a mechanism to get real-time alerts (e.g. via email/SMS) to the concerned people for required actions.

## Proposed Tech Stack

- Flutter and Dart for Frontend application.

## Working & Usage

In order to get started contributing/building the flutter project, first get Flutter (this project was made with version 3.3.9).  
Clone this Repository

```
git clone LemonDrop847/ecodroid
```

Get packages

```
flutter pub get
```

Build and run main.dart.

## What we learned ðŸ¤“

We are a group of developers who are open to learning and experimenting with new tech. During this hackathon we learnt -

1. Using ML models in a flutter App.
2. Usage of cloud storage with database integrations within flutter.
3. Learnt about more exciting upcoming and already existing face recognition and detection tech.

## Problems we ran Into

1. Most ML models dont seem to work with flutter and/or are outdated.
2. Flutter firebase packages dont go well together. A loophole was dont to fix this but this is by no means a permanent solution.
3. Flutter, beacuse of being new lacks a lot of documentation on very specific topics.
